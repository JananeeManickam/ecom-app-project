**ABSTRACT**

This project presents a comprehensive eCommerce application integrating PayPal as its payment gateway. Built on the MERN stack, it leverages MongoDB for database management, Node.js and Express.js for backend functionality, and React.js for the frontend interface.

The platform accommodates two user types: Admin and Common Users. Admins possess exclusive privileges to manage stock details, including addition, modification, and deletion. Common Users, on the other hand, can add and remove items from their carts, with constraints ensuring unavailable stock items cannot be added.

Upon finalizing their product selection and adding items to their cart, users proceed to the checkout process, where they select their preferred payment method, currently limited to PayPal and credit card. Once the payment method is selected, users are prompted to provide necessary delivery details, ensuring accurate and timely order fulfillment.

Before finalizing the order, users are presented with a comprehensive order summary. A comprehensive order summary precedes final order placement, enhancing user experience and transaction transparency.
